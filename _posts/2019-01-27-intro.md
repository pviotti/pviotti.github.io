I've decided to dust this little blog that I used to (inconstantly) update during my PhD.
This time I will use it to document my little everyday hacks and
thoughts about technology.
In part, it is also an effort to get past the perfectionism and the fear of being judged;
an effort of being that [active 1%][one-percent] of the internet,
and of being part of the tech community by sharing my opinions.

PS: I changed the name of this blog to "sitzfleisch", because [apparently][sitzfleisch-def]
it means both "ability to endure or carry on with an activity", and "buttocks" :D
