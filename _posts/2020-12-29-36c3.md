These days, one year ago, I attended the 36th [Chaos Communication Congress][36C3] (36C3) in Leipzig, Germany.
It was the first Congress I ever attended, and while I had some preconceptions,
I did not expect it to be such an *awesome* conference.
Over the years, I've been lucky enough to attend a number conferences and workshops
for IT practitioners and researchers - none of them come close to 36C3 for
its compelling and fun talks, its creative vibes and its pervasive feeling of inclusivity.
The Congress offers lectures and workshops on a wide variety of topics centered
around information technology and its effects on society.
There you can also attend a workshop on learning Chinese, or on how to prepare kefir;
listen to a famous cryptographer discuss the latest advances in privacy preserving technologies;
enjoy a robots battle; or simply chat with one of the other 16k+ fellows hackers / researchers /
human beings.

Since it's hard to capture in a few lines the Congress,[^1] I
will at least list below a few talks that I found interesting (among those that got
recorded).
Due to the ongoing pandemic, this year's Congress has been [virtual only][rC3].
While it's definitely not the same experience as the non-remote one, I'm sure
there will be plenty of interesting [videos to watch](https://media.ccc.de/c/rc3).
