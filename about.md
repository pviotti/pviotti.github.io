**Hi there! I'm Paolo ðŸ‘‹**
<br/>
<br/>

I'm a software engineer and former researcher currently based in Ireland.

<br/>
I like computers ([distributed
systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/distributed-system.txt), in
particular), and I also like many other things not related to computers.
In case you need it, [here's my resume](assets/viotti-resume-2020.pdf) (updated in early 2020).
Notice that nothing written here represents the views of my current or past
employers.
